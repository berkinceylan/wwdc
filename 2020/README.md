# WWDC20: Escape DubDub

This is my WWDC 2020 Scholarship Submission, Escape DubDub. Escape DubDub is a fun recreation of an escape room in AR, allowing you to experience exciting puzzles and challenges similar to a real escape room from the comfort of your home. While you play, learn about some key Computer Science concepts linked to the puzzles. This game is targeted towards young teenagers who are interested in learning more about CS.
